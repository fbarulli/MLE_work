    "Decision trees (Decision Tree) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules derived from the data features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree can be described as a visual representation of a data classification algorithm following different criteria called decisions (or nodes). Each node corresponds to a test on a training variable, and each of the subsequent branches represents a result of this test. Each leaf of the tree (terminal nodes) contains a value of the target variable, a label in the case of classification.\n",

    "During model training, nodes are created from \"optimal\" tests with respect to the training set, and this process ends when the tree leaves are homogeneous or meet a certain stopping criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decision tree thus allows, after training on a data set, to easily make predictions in the form of successive logical classification rules. The results are easily interpretable and therefore exploitable, making communication about modeling easier. It is therefore a highly appreciated and used classifier in industry.\n",

    "The construction of a decision tree is generally done in 2 phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first phase consists of constructing the nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from a training set, a recursive process of dividing the data space into increasingly pure subsamples in terms of classes is initiated, based on a predefined criterion.\n",
    "The classification problem is thus broken down into a sequence of (nested) tests on a variable of the form \"X>=threshold\".\n",
    "At each node, the best test is selected according to a certain criterion (often based on information theory, and notably on the notion of entropy), whose objective is to minimize the mixing of classes within each subset created by the different test alternatives.\n",
    "This results in a succession of classification rules in the form of a tree, each end (or \"leaf\") indicating membership in a class.\n",
    "The class allocated to a leaf is determined by the class mostly represented among the data in the training set that \"fall\" into that leaf.\n",
    "The objective of this phase is to generate a hierarchical sequence of tests, as short as possible, which successively divides the entire training data set into disjoint subsets, such that subgroups of cases belonging to the same class are quickly detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second phase is pruning:\n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of removing poorly representative branches to maintain good predictive performance. This step requires the creation of a criterion/metric to designate branches to prune, which will depend on the algorithm used.\n",
    "After pruning, the branches are replaced by terminal nodes, labeled based on the distribution of the training data (majority class).\n",
    "Generally, pruning is done from the bottom up of the tree (\"bottom-up\"). It is based on an estimate (cross-validation, new sample, statistical estimation, etc.) of the classification error rate: a tree is pruned at a certain node if the estimated error rate at this node (by allocating the majority class) is lower than the error rate obtained by considering the terminal sub-trees.\n",
    "Pruning proceeds successively (from the beginning of the branches) until all remaining sub-trees satisfy the condition on the classification error rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The DecisionTreeClassifier function allows you to create a classifier based on a decision tree. Many parameters can be given to it such as the criterion for evaluating partitions criterion, the maximum depth of the tree, the number of features to consider at each node, etc.  "
